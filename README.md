Rice, the programming language by Dennis King.

Okay so lets get one thing out of the way first, why rice?... the  answer to that question is quite simple,  I called the language rice because I love rice, easy. I mean I really really love to eat rice, I'm obssessed with rice, hell, sometimes I'll even go as far as having 6 plates of rice a day. Just plain, dry and unsalted rice, that's the way I love it and that's the best way to serve it. Just give me a bowl of rice and I'm happy.
