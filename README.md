# Rice?
**Rice**, the programming language by Dennis King.

Okay so let's get one thing out of the way first, why Rice?... the  answer to that question is quite simple, I called the language Rice because I love rice, I mean I really really love to **Eat** rice, I'm obssessed with rice, hell, sometimes I'll even go as far as having 6 bowls of rice a day. I absolutely adore rice in its simplest form â€“ plain, dry, and unsalted. There's something about its unadorned simplicity that truly captivates me. The texture of each individual **Grain** as it dances on my taste buds is pure bliss. The subtle nuttiness of the rice shines through, unhindered by any seasoning distractions. It's almost as if every mouthful takes me to a place of culinary enlightenment. Many people find this preference unusual, but I revel in the natural flavors and wholesome essence of plain rice. There's a certain purity to it, a blank canvas awaiting my appreciation. It literally complements any dish I pair it with, acting as a neutral foundation for flavors to build upon. I relish the opportunity to let the rice take center stage, allowing me to truly appreciate its humble and unpretentious nature. Just plain, dry and unsalted rice, that's the way I love it and that's the best way to serve it.

Just give me a **Bowl** of rice and I'm happy.


# Conclusion
Help me make Rice an official and a recognised programming language.
