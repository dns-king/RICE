# Why Rice?
**Rice**, the programming language by Dennis King.

Okay so let's get one thing out of the way first, why Rice?... the  answer to that question is quite simple, I called the language Rice because I love rice, I mean I really really love to **Eat** rice, I'm obssessed with rice, hell, sometimes I'll even go as far as having 6 bowls of rice a day. Just plain, dry and unsalted rice, that's the way I love it and that's the best way to serve it. I absolutely adore rice in its simplest form â€“ plain, dry, and unsalted. There's something about its unadorned simplicity that truly captivates me. The texture of each individual **Grain** as it dances on my metaphorical taste buds is pure bliss. The subtle nuttiness of the rice shines through, unhindered by any seasoning distractions. It's as if every mouthful transports me to a realm of culinary enlightenment. While others may find this preference unusual, I revel in the natural flavors and wholesome essence of plain rice. There's a certain purity to it, a blank canvas awaiting my appreciation. It complements any dish I pair it with, acting as a neutral foundation for flavors to build upon. I relish the opportunity to let the rice take center stage, allowing me to truly appreciate its humble and unpretentious nature.

Just give me a **Bowl** of rice and I'm happy.

# Rice
Rice is a simple and lightweight programming language designed for basic operations, string manipulation, and console output. It aims to provide an intuitive and readable syntax similar to Java while offering a reduced set of features. The **main** goal for Rice is for it to become the standard programming language that beginner devs or anyone that is interested in coding start learning. Rice should be the "intro to software development" language. I want this to be case because of Rice's very basic program structure that is sooooo incredibly easy to understand, in fact kids as young as 5 can even use it, let's teach kids how to program guys? we can do that with Rice... my goodness, Rice is so simple!!

# Syntax
Rice programs follow a structure similar to Java:

````
Rice {
  Cook main() {
    // Program code goes here
  }
}
````
The main reason behind this idea, was that Rice should be structured in a way that follows the concept or the process of actually cooking rice. You see this clearly if you pay attention to the structure of a Rice program.

<li>The <b>Rice block</b> is the top-level structure of a Rice program.
<li>The <b>Cook main() block</b> contains the entry point of the program, similar to the main method in Java.
<li>Write your <b>Rice code</b> inside the main block.

## Data Types
Rice only supports two data types.

<ol>
<li></li>
<li></li>
</ol>
